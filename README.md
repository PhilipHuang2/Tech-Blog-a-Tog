# Tech-Blog-a-Tog
Drop the Tog, and Eat some Advice

This project was brutal, each route was through multiple files, and through multiple packages.  Deploying through heroku is a pain and a half.  Full Stack app require a view, controller, and model access at all times.  For Any routes, dealing with the view/ javascript, and calling the APIs is tough work.  Wrangling them all together is so bad.

I need to rework this. Not using partials stuck me in the ass, cause I was reusing code for displaying posts in the dashboard, and the landing page.  It was a good experience tough.
